The goal of this practice is to Refactor the class Grid.
We have realised that x,y params in all the methods can be replaced by a data clump, let's call it Coordinate.
So we went to make this refactor.

Rules:
- The tests in GridTest cannot be changed until we are sure our code behaves the same than before.
- We will work in small steps, each step needs to make pass all the tests. Each small step can be a commit.
- We will work in pairs, each one will fork this project.
- We will discuss again in 10 mins.
